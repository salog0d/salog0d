# Salogodd
Hello, my name is David Salom√≥n Nava. I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Engineering in Computational Technologies at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. My journey into programming began early, and I am passionate about software development and data science.

At Tec de Monterrey, I am gaining a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. This program has equipped me with skills in various programming languages and frameworks, allowing me to work on diverse projects.

I am particularly interested in developing web applications and exploring emerging technologies. I enjoy collaborating with peers on innovative solutions and participating in coding competitions, which further enhances my skills.

If you want to connect or collaborate on projects, feel free to reach out!
